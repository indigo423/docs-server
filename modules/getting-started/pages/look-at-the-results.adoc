Once you have Couchbase Server running, you can log into the _Couchbase Web Console_, and start to examine the different features that it provides.
These include a facility for inspecting Couchbase _documents_, organized within _buckets_.

== Access the Console and Log in

The default location for the Couchbase Web Console (whether it is running, as here, in a Docker virtual environment, or directly on your platform) is `localhost:8091`.
So, type this into the address-bar of your browser, and hit return.
The following log-in screen is displayed:

[#console_login]
image::consoleLogin.png[,320,align=left]

The credentials you now enter are ones that have been established by default, by Docker.
Your username is `Administrator`, and your password is `password`.
Type these into the appropriate fields, and again hit return.

== Examine the Cluster Dashboard

You now see the following screen:

[#cluster_overview]
image::ClusterOverview.png[,720,align=left]

This is the [.uicontrol]*Cluster Dashboard* screen, which provides a graphical summary of the current state of your Couchbase cluster.
The term _cluster_ might seem unexpected at this point, since you are only running a single instance of Couchbase Server: but that nevertheless does count as a cluster of one.

All the values displayed on this screen were configured by default, when you installed Couchbase Server by means of Docker.
In production, you will specify these values individually, according to your needs.

Notice the [.uicontrol]*Buckets* panel, towards the bottom.
This shows that you have a single active bucket on the system â€” _bucket_ meaning a logical group of data-items.
Taking a closer look at this bucket will give you some idea of how Couchbase stores data, and so prepare your way for making data-queries.
So, left-click on the [.uicontrol]*Buckets* tab, on the vertical control-bar, at the left-hand side of the console:

[#data_buckets_tab]
image::dataBucketsTab.png[,110,align=left]

This now brings up the [.uicontrol]*Buckets* screen.

== Examine your Bucket and its Documents

The [.uicontrol]*Buckets* screen provides information on the single bucket you currently have on the system:

[#travel_sample_bucket_screen_initial]
image::travelSampleBucketScreenInitial.png[,720,align=left]

The name of the single bucket, `travel-sample` appears towards the left of the single row.
Additional information is provided in columns, across the row.

To inspect the individual documents contained within this bucket, left-click on the [.uicontrol]*Documents* button, which is towards the right of the `travel-sample` row.

[#document_button]
image::documentsButton.png[,110,align=left]

The display now changes to the following:

[#travel_sample_bucket_screen]
image::travelSampleBucketScreen.png[,720,align=left]

This shows, in a succession of page-views, the Couchbase documents that are contained within the bucket.
In the upper panel, the following interactive components are provided:

* *Bucket*: Displays the name of the bucket whose documents are being viewed.
Use the control at the right of the field to select other available buckets, from a pull-down menu.
+
{blank}

* *Limit*: Displays an integer indicating the maximum number of rows (each corresponding to a document) that can be displayed.
+
{blank}

* *Offset*: Displays an integer indicating the number of documents in the entire set of the current bucket that should be skipped, before display begins.
+
{blank}

* *Where*: Accepts a _N1QL_ query, which determines the subset of documents displayed.
(N1QL is introduced later in this sequence.)
+
{blank}

* [.uicontrol]*Retrieve Docs*: Left-click to retrieve documents from the current bucket, as determined by the values entered in the interactive fields to the left of the button.

In the lower panel, each document is represented by an individual row.
The ID of the document appears to the left, in the *id* column.
At the extreme left of the column, for each row, appear four buttons.
From left to right, these are:

* *Save changes to document*: If you make changes (as described below), this button becomes active for the current row.
By left-clicking, you save the changes to the document.
+
{blank}

* *Make a copy of this document*: If you left-click on this, the [.uicontrol]*Save As* dialog appears:
+
[#save_as_dialog]
image::saveAsDialog.png[,280,align=left]
+
{blank}
+
Either left-click the btn:[Save] button to save the copy under the placeholder-name provided, or edit the placeholder-name before saving.

* *Edit document as JSON*: Left-click on this button to bring up the [.uicontrol]*Edit Document* dialog, which allows direct edits to be made:
+
[#edit_document_dialog]
image::editDocumentDialog.png[,480,align=left]
+
{blank}
+
The document consists of a series of _name-value_ (or, as they are sometimes expressed, _key-value_) pairs.
You can make modifications to these directly, in this editor.
As will be demonstrated later, Couchbase Server allows you to search for keys, and return the corresponding values, by means of a _query_.
For example, here, if you searched on the name `country`, you would return the value `United States`; if on the name `icao`, the value `MLA`.
+
{blank}
+
Left-click on the btn:[Save] button, to save.
Note that at the extreme upper right of the *Documents* screen is the [.uicontrol]*Add Document* button.
Left-click on this to bring up the *Add Document* dialog which (like the *Save As* dialog previously described) allows a document-name to be specified.
Subsequently, you can create and save a new document, in the *Edit Document* dialog.

* *Delete this document*: Left-click on this button to delete the document on the current row.

In the main body of the display, the JSON document is displayed as text.
Note that you can also view the document in tabular form, by switching the toggle that appears immediately above the main panel:

[#document_display_toggle]
image::documentDisplayToggle.png[,110,align=left]

The main display-panel now appears as follows:

[#travel_sample_bucket_screen_with_table]
image::travelSampleBucketScreenWithTable.png[,720,align=left]

Each key in the current document has its own column, in which the corresponding value for each document is provided, row by row.
All value-fields are interactively editable, and can be expanded by selecting and dragging the lower-right corner of the field.

To view successive sets of documents, left-click the [.uicontrol]*Next Batch* button, at the upper right.

== Next

Now that you have a basic familiarity with the way in which Couchbase Server organizes data, you can start to define and execute _queries_, in order to return specific data-subsets.
You'll experiment with this in the next section, xref:getting-started:try-a-query.adoc[Run Your First N1QL Query].

== Other Destinations

To learn more about the Couchbase data-model, take a look at the introduction to xref:data-modeling:intro-data-modeling.adoc[Data Modeling Basics].
This provides an extensive _conceptual_ account of Couchbase buckets.
Additional, _practical_ information can be found in the section xref:clustersetup:bucket-setup.adoc[Setting Up Buckets].
