= Bucket protection

[abstract]
Couchbase Server provides bucket security using bucket authentication and removal of unprotected buckets.

== Bucket authentication

Couchbase Server authenticates buckets using the SASL password.

For more information, see xref:security-authentication.adoc#topic_ztr_rnm_lq[Authentication].

== Removal of unprotected buckets

To safeguard security in the production phase, delete the buckets created by the Couchbase Server as a part of the installation process.

This applies to:

* Default bucket, which has no password support.
* Any sample buckets supplied with empty passwords.
