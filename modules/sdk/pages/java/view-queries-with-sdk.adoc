== Querying Views through the Java SDK

Query a view through the Java client through the `query(ViewQuery q)` method on the [.api]`Bucket` class.
This method returns a [.api]`ViewResult` whose iterator yields the results of the query (in the form of [.api]`ViewRow` objects).
The [.api]`ViewResult` also exposes the list of rows (`allRows()`), the `success()` status and potential `error()`.
The [.api]`ViewRow` object contains the `key` and `value` properties (which are the first and second arguments to the view's `emit()` function, respectively) as well as the `id` property, which may be passed to the [.api]`get()` method to return the actual document.
Alternatively, directly call the [.api]`document()` method on the view row.

[source,java]
----
Bucket bkt = CouchbaseCluster.create("192.168.33.101").openBucket("beer-sample");
ViewResult result = bkt.query(ViewQuery.from("beer", "by_name");
for (ViewRow row : result) {
    System.out.println(row); //prints the row
    System.out.println(row.document().content()); //retrieves the doc and prints content
}
----

You can also set various properties on the query:

[source,java]
----
Bucket bkt = CouchbaseCluster.create("192.168.33.101").openBucket("beer-sample");
ViewQuery q = ViewQuery.from("beer", "by_name")
    .limit(5) // Limit to 5 results
    .startKey("A")
    .endKey("A\u0fff");

ViewResult result = bkt.query(q);
for (ViewRow row : result) {
    System.out.println(row);
}
----

Here's some sample output for the previous query:

----
DefaultViewRow{id=harvey_son_lewes-a_lecoq_imperial_extra_double_stout_1999, key=A. LeCoq Imperial Extra Double Stout 1999, value=null}
DefaultViewRow{id=harvey_son_lewes-a_lecoq_imperial_extra_double_stout_2000, key=A. LeCoq Imperial Extra Double Stout 2000, value=null}
DefaultViewRow{id=mickey_finn_s_brewery-abana_amber_ale, key=Abana Amber Ale, value=null}
DefaultViewRow{id=brasserie_lefebvre-abbaye_de_floreffe_double, key=Abbaye de Floreffe Double, value=null}
DefaultViewRow{id=brasserie_de_brunehaut-abbaye_de_saint_martin_blonde, key=Abbaye de Saint-Martin Blonde, value=null}
----

[TIP]
====
It is only beneficial in the synchronous API (in the async API you could just call `get(row.id())` on the async bucket with the same effects).
It impacts the row's `document(...)` method by preloading the return value of said method.

However, since the simple signature of `row.document()` assumes a `JsonDocument`, if you want a different document type you have to call both `includeDocs()` and `document()` with the desired target class: `query.includeDocs(SomeDocumentClass.class)` *and* `row.document(SomeDocumentClass.class)`.

Note that the `ViewQuery` has a getter for the target class: `includeDocsTarget()`.

== Querying Geospatial Views

To query a geospatial view, you will need to construct a [.api]`SpatialViewQuery` object ([.api]`com.couchbase.client.java.view.SpatialViewQuery`).
Spatial queries accept a [.param]`startRange` and an [.param]`endRange` parameter which allow you to limit the enclosing bounding boxes of the result.
The arguments to these parameters are [.api]`JsonArray` with each element corresponding to a component emitted by the key (the first two components implicitly being the longitude and latitude of the result itself).

On output, spatial queries yield instances of [.api]`SpatialViewRow` classes.
A [.api]`SpatialViewRow` is similar to a [.api]`ViewRow`, with an added `geometry` property.

.Querying a spatial view
[source,java]
----
SpatialViewQuery q = SpatialViewQuery.from("spatial", "by_location")
    .startRange(JsonArray.from(0, -90, null))
    .endRange(JsonArray.from(180, 90, null));
SpatialViewResult result = bkt.query(q);

for (SpatialViewRow row : result) {
    System.out.println("Key:" + row.key());
    System.out.println("Value:" + row.value());
    System.out.println("Geometry:" + row.geometry());
}
----

[.api]`SpatialView` also has the [.api]`includeDocs()` parameter to preload the document for the [.api]`SpatialViewRow`'s [.api]`document()` method.

== View results details

For all types of views, a `ViewResult` is always returned, which contains zero to many `ViewRows`.
In addition to iterative row access, more methods are available on the result:

[cols="50,97"]
|===
| Method | Description

| `List<ViewRow> allRows()`
| Accumulates all returned rows in a List and returns it.

| `Iterator<ViewRow> rows()`
| Provides iterative access to rows as they arrive.

| `int totalRows()`
| The total number of rows in the index can be greater than the number of `rows()` returned.

| `boolean success()`
| True if the query was successful, false otherwise.
Check `error()` if so.

| `JsonObject error()`
| Contains the error if the query was not successful or null otherwise.

| `JsonObject debug()`
| Contains debug information if `debug()` was enabled on the query, null otherwise.
|===

The only difference between regular and spatial view results is the fact that spatial ones do not expose the number of `totalRows`.

== ViewQuery API details

All options shown here are available on the `ViewQuery` in a fluent API manner.
All of them are optional, so only when they are explicitly provided, they will alter the behavior of the query.

As a general note, all arguments that accept JSON are provided with a higher number of method overloads to accommodate all combinations in a type-safe manner.

[cols="100,139,261"]
|===
| Method | Accepted Types | Description

| `development`
| `boolean`
| When true queries the development view, false by default.

| `reduce`
| `boolean`
| Explicitly enables/disables the reduce function on the query.
If not provided and the view has a reduce function, it will be used.

| `limit`
| `int`
| Limits the number of the returned documents to the specified number.

| `skip`
| `int`
| Skips the given number of records before starting to return the results.

| `group`
| `boolean`
| Groups the results using the reduce function to a group or single row.

| `groupLevel`
| `int`
| Specifies the group level to be used.

| `inclusiveEnd`
| `boolean`
| Whether the specified end key should be included in the result.

| `stale`
| `Stale.TRUE, Stale.FALSE, Stale.UPDATE_AFTER (default)`
| Defines how stale the view results are allowed to be in the query.

| `debug`
| `boolean`
| Enabled debugging on view queries.

| `onError`
| `OnError.STOP (default), OnError.CONTINUE`
| Sets the response in the event of an error.

| `descending`
| `boolean`
| Returns the documents in descending order by key if `true`, default is `false`.

| `key`
| `JSON`
| The exact key to return from the query.

| `keys`
| `JsonArray`
| Only the given matching keys will be returned.

| `startKeyDocId`
| `String`
| Where to start searching for the key range.
Can be used for efficient pagination.

| `endKeyDocId`
| `String`
| Where to stop searching for the key range.

| `startKey`
| `JSON`
| The key where the row return range should start.

| `endKey`
| `JSON`
| The key where the row return range should end.

| `includeDocs`
| `boolean`, optional `Class<? extends Document>`
| Wether or not to automatically fetch the document corresponding to each row.
The second parameter is the target class for the document, `JsonDocument` if omitted.

This method is needed only when using the blocking API since on the async API there is no benefit over just calling [.api]`.document()` in the stream.

See note on `includeDocs` below.
|===

NOTE: *Important when using Grouping:*`group(boolean)` and `groupLevel(int)` should not be used together in the same view query.
It is sufficient only to set the grouping level only and use this setter in cases where you always want the highest group level implicitly.

== SpatialViewQuery API details

All options shown here are available on the `SpatialViewQuery` in a fluent API manner.
All of them are optional, so only when they are explicitly provided, they will alter the behaviour of the query.

[cols="100,147,245"]
|===
| Method | Accepted Types | Description

| `development`
| `boolean`
| When true queries the development view, false by default.

| `limit`
| `int`
| Limits the number of the returned documents to the specified number.

| `skip`
| `int`
| Skips the given number of records before starting to return the results.

| `stale`
| `Stale.TRUE, Stale.FALSE, Stale.UPDATE_AFTER (default)`
| Defines how stale the view results are allowed to be on query.

| `debug`
| `boolean`
| Enabled debugging on view queries.

| `onError`
| `OnError.STOP (default), OnError.CONTINUE`
| Sets the response in the event of an error.

| `startRange`
| `JsonArray`
| Where the spatial range should start.
Can be multidimensional.

| `endRange`
| `JsonArray`
| Where the spatial range should end.
Can be multidimensional.

| `range`
| `JsonArray, JsonArray`
| Convenience method to combine start and endrange in one argument.

| `includeDocs`
| `boolean`, optional `Class<? extends Document>>`
| Weather or not to automatically fetch the document corresponding to each row.
The second parameter is the target class for the document, `JsonDocument` if omitted.

This method is needed only when using the blocking API since on the async API there is no benefit over just calling [.api]`.document()` in the stream.

See note on `includeDocs` below.
|===

Here is how to use the `range` parameter to find documents with a location within a bounding box.
We have stored cities Paris, Vienna, Berlin and New York.
Each city's coordinates is represented as two attributes, `lon` and `lat`.
The spatial view's map function is:

[source,javascript]
----
function (doc) { if (doc.type == "city") { emit([doc.lon, doc.lat], null); } }
----

To query the view and find cities within Europe, we use Europe's bouding box.
The startRange is the most south-western point of the bounding box, the endRange is its most north-eastern point:

[source,java]
----
JsonArray EUROPE_SOUTH_WEST = JsonArray.from(-10.8, 36.59);
JsonArray EUROPE_NORTH_EAST = JsonArray.from(31.6, 70.67);

SpatialViewResult result = bucket.query(SpatialViewQuery.from("cities", "by_location")
            .stale(Stale.FALSE)
            .range(EUROPE_SOUTH_WEST, EUROPE_NORTH_EAST));
List<SpatialViewRow> allRows = result.allRows();

for (SpatialViewRow row : allRows) {
    System.out.println(row.id());
}

//prints:
//city::Vienna
//city::Berlin
//city::Paris
----

[#retry]
== Retry Conditions

SDK retries view requests automatically on certain known conditions, which represented in the following table:

[cols="25,39"]
|===
| HTTP status code | Behavior

| 200
| Do not retry request.

| 300, 301, 302, 303, 307, 401, 408, 409, 412, 416, 417, 501, 502, 503, 504
| Retry request.

| 404
| In case the library detects yet unprovisioned node, it will retry.
Otherwise, it will report `ViewDoesNotExistException`.

| 500
| If the error payload reports missing view document or badly formed query, it will not retry.
Otherwise, it will retry request.
|===

All codes not listed in the table will not be retried by default.
But the client code still can use retrying framework or write a custom handler.
In the example below, it will retry 10 times if the view does not exist:

[source,java]
----
bucket.query(SpatialViewQuery.from("spatial", "test"))
      .retryWhen(
           RetryBuilder.anyOf(ViewDoesNotExistException.class)
                       .delay(Delay.exponential(TimeUnit.SECONDS, 1))
                       .max(10)
                       .build())
      .subscribe(new Action1<AsyncSpatialViewResult>() {
          @Override
          public void call(AsyncSpatialViewResult result) {
              // handle result
          }
      });
