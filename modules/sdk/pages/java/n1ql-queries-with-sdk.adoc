= N1QL Queries Using the Java SDK with Couchbase Server
:navtitle: N1QL from the SDK

[abstract]
You can perform N1QL queries via the Java client.

NOTE: See Couchbase Developer documentation for a quick intro to xref:..:architecture/querying-data-with-n1ql.adoc#concept_igg_kq4_vs[N1QL].

To issue N1QL queries, you should create a [.api]`N1qlQuery` object, and pass it to the [.api]`query(N1qlQuery q)` method in the [.api]`Bucket` class.
A few variants of such a query exist:

* Simple queries, which are only strings and do not use placeholders;
* Parameterized queries, which use numbered or named placeholders.

You can create each via the corresponding factory method on `N1qlQuery`, which you can create using a Statement produced by the N1QL DSL or using the statement directly as a String.

The return value from [.api]`query()` is the object [.api]`N1qlQueryResult`.
Iterating over the object will yield the rows returned by the server for the given query (as `N1qlQueryRow`).
Each row represents a row received for the query.

Additionally, you can get the [.api]`List<N1qlQueryRow>` from the [.api]`allRows()` method on the result.
Note that errors returned by the N1QL service during execution are represented as [.api]`JsonObject` accessible through the [.api]`errors()` method, rather than exceptions.
Here is the complete list of [.api]`N1qlQueryResult` methods:

* `parseSuccess`: Returns `true` if the query could be parsed correctly.
This information is available immediately even if the actual list of results takes more time to be computed and streamed to the client.
* `finalSuccess`: Returns `true` if the whole query could be executed successfully, including retrieving all the results and streaming them to the client.
* `allRows`: Contains all rows returned by the query; it can be an empty list.
* `rows`: Same as `allRows` but in an iterator form (the [.api]`N1qlQueryResult` itself is iterable).
* `requestId`: The server-generated unique ID for this query (useful to find associated logs on the N1QL server).
* `clientContextId`: User-provided identifier reflected in the server's response.
The identifier can be useful for grouping several queries (for example, in a kind of in-house transaction) and find all associated queries.
* `info`: Returns a [.api]`N1qlMetrics` object, which contains metrics for the query (such as the number of results or processing time).
* `errors`: Returns a list of [.api]`JsonObject` describing errors or warnings (if any occurred during execution).

Each [.api]`N1qlQueryRow` exposes the JSON representation of the `value()` as a [.api]`JsonObject`.
It also gives the raw bytes for said value (`byteValue()`), in case you need them to apply your deserialization or `SELECT RAW` is used which cannot be turned into a `JsonObject`.

You can use N1QL placeholders in the query.
Placeholders allow you to specify variable constraints for an otherwise constant query.
A named or positional parameter is a placeholder for a value in the WHERE, LIMIT or OFFSET clause of a query.
To use placeholders, manually construct a `N1QLQuery` object with the base query string, and use a [.api]`JsonObject` of names -> keyword or a [.api]`JsonArray` of positional arguments for named or positional placeholders, respectively:

.N1QL Query with placeholders
[source,java]
----
import static com.couchbase.client.java.query.Select.select;
import static com.couchbase.client.java.query.dsl.Expression.*;

// ...
Statement statement = select("fname", "lname", "age").from(i("default")).where(x("age").gt(x("$age")));
JsonObject placeholderValues = JsonObject.create().put("age", 22);
q = N1qlQuery.parameterized(statement, placeholderValues);
for (N1qlQueryRow row : bkt.query(q)) {
    System.out.println(row);
}
----

N1QL queries can also be fine tuned by setting options using [.api]`N1qlParams` object.
These parameters should be added to the query object during creation.
Here is a subset of options that can be tuned:

* [.api]`serverSideTimeout` - sets the maximum server side timeout for the query.
* [.api]`withContextId` - adds client context ID to the request that will be sent back in the response, allowing clients to meaningfully trace requests/responses when many are exchanged.
* [.api]`consistency` - sets the consistency level for the query.
* [.api]`maxParallelism` - can override the max parallelism used by the server.
* [.api]`adhoc` - allows to specify if this query is adhoc or not.

.Adding N1QL parameters to Query
[source,java]
----
//Using N1qlParams to set adhoc as false for using prepared statements
N1qlParams params = N1qlParams.build().adhoc(false);
N1qlQuery query = N1qlQuery.simple("select count(*) from `mybucket`", params);
----

== Building Statements with the DSL

The N1QL domain-specific language (DSL) is a powerful way to guide you in building your statements: you obtain type safety and autocompletion of relevant methods / N1QL clauses.

As of the `2.2.3` version of the SDK, the DSL supports the following features:

* Data selection with [.api]`Select.select(...)` as an entry point (including index hinting).
* All N1QL functions, organized by topic in the helper classes in the [.api]`com.couchbase.client.java.query.dsl.functions` package (eg.
[.api]`AggregateFunctions`).
* A <<case,mini DSL for building CASE constructs>> via factory methods on the [.api]`Case` class.
* A <<collections,mini DSL for building collection constructs>> (ANY, EVERY, ARRAY...) via factory methods on the [.api]`Collections` class.
* Index management (index and primary index creation/deletion/deferred building) with [.api]`Index` factory methods as an entry point.
* Data modification with [.api]`Insert`, [.api]`Update`, [.api]`Upsert` and [.api]`Delete` as entry points.

To construct statements, you can use the [.api]`Expression` class that comes in with a variety of factory methods to construct both tokens and literals programmatically.
Expressions can be combined and chained with operators (like [.api]`gte` for "greater than or equal to" comparison).

Use [.api]`x` to construct a token, [.api]`s` to construct a string literal, [.api]`i` to construct a token escaped with backticks (for example, the bucket name `beer-sample` must be escaped because it contains a dash).

If you find out that the DSL doesn't support a particular statement, clause or keyword, *you can always revert to providing your statement in plain String form*.
Using the String form ensures that even if the DSL lags behind the evolutions of the language, users will always have a mean of using new language features.

== Querying Asynchronously

To perform a query asynchronously, use the [.api]`AsyncBucket` interface that you obtain by calling [.api]`bucket.async()`.
The API is pretty similar except everything is returned as an [.api]`Observable`.
Some of the components of the query result (an [.api]`AsyncQueryResult`) can also be delayed and so returned as Observables.
Only [.api]`requestId`, [.api]`clientContextId` and [.api]`parseSuccess` return immediately.

The following Java 8 code prints the found documents or errors as they come:

[source,java]
----
bucket.async()
    .query(select("*").from(i("beer-sample")).limit(10))
    .flatMap(result ->
        result.errors()
        .flatMap(e -> Observable.<AsyncN1qlQueryRow>error(new CouchbaseException("N1QL Error/Warning: " + e)))
        .switchIfEmpty(result.rows())
    )
    .map(AsyncN1qlQueryRow::value)
    .subscribe(
        rowContent -> System.out.println(rowContent),
        runtimeError -> runtimeError.printStackTrace()
    );
----

First, you can see that asynchronous mode was used.

Second, line issues a [.api]`Statement` using the DSL (notice how "beer-sample" is escaped).

When receiving a result, first check if there are errors.
If there are any, the first one is converted to a [.api]`CouchbaseException` that will be propagated in the [.api]`Observable`.
If no errors are found ([.api]`errors()` is empty), switch to inspecting the rows, then map each received row to its JSON value.

Eventually, trigger the whole process by subscribing to the [.api]`Observable` you have built.
When a row JSON is received, print it; when an error is propagated, print the stack trace.

_Note: All this is done asynchronously so it's not suitable for a simple test (where the main thread would potentially exit before any result could have been displayed)._

[#case]
== Conditionals, Case Expressions Mini DSL

The [.api]`com.couchbase.client.java.query.dsl.functions.Case` class contains a mini-DSL to deal with Conditional operators in N1QL of the `CASE` family.

The `Simple CASE` expression is defined as:

[source,sql]
----
CASE expression  ( WHEN expression THEN expression)
[ ( WHEN expression THEN expression) ]*
[  ELSE expression ]  END
----

The `Searched CASE` expression is defined as:

[source,sql]
----
CASE  ( WHEN  condition THEN expression)
[( WHEN  condition THEN expression ) ]*
[ ELSE  expression ] END
----

The corresponding mini-DSL are [.api]`Case.caseSimple` and [.api]`Case.caseSearch`.
Simple Case will compare the initial expression with each `WHEN` clause for equality, returning the corresponding `THEN` expression if a match is found.
Search Case allows for a different condition for each `WHEN` clause.

Let's see two examples.
The first one could be used to map match results to a score:

[source,sql]
----
CASE hist.result WHEN "won" THEN 1 ELSE 0 END
----

[source,java]
----
//import static com.couchbase.client.java.query.dsl.Expression.*;
//import static com.couchbase.client.java.query.dsl.functions.Case.*;

caseSimple(x("hist.result"))
    .when(s("won")).then(x(1))
    .elseReturn(x(0))
----

The second example implements more complex scoring rule using a Search Case (first match of the day counts as 5 points if won):

[source,sql]
----
CASE WHEN hist.result = "won" AND hist.matchNumber = 1 THEN 5
WHEN hist.result = "won" THEN 1
WHEN hist.result = "lost" THEN 0
END
----

[source,java]
----
//import static com.couchbase.client.java.query.dsl.Expression.*;
//import static com.couchbase.client.java.query.dsl.functions.Case.*;

caseSearch()
    .when(x("hist.result").eq(s("won")).and(x("hist.matchNumber").eq(1))).then(x(5))
    .when(x("hist.result").eq(s("won"))).then(x(1))
    .when(x("hist.result").eq(s("lost"))).then(x(0))
    .end(); //no ELSE clause means other values will return NULL, have to explicitly close the CASE
----

[#collections]
== Collection Operators Mini DSL

The [.api]`com.couchbase.client.java.query.dsl.functions.Collections` class contains a mini-DSL to deal with Collections operators in N1QL, such as `ANY`, `EVERY`, `ARRAY` and `FIRST`.

For example, the `ARRAY` construct is defined as:

[source,sql]
----
ARRAY expression FOR variable ( IN |  WITHIN ) expression
[ ,  variable ( IN | WITHIN ) expression ]* [ ( WHEN  condition) ] END
----

The corresponding mini-DSL is [.api]`Collections.arrayIn` (or [.api]`Collections.arrayWithin` if you want to start with a `WITHIN` clause).
Let's see two examples from the following statement, which extracts children and also lists the ones that are "teenagers":

[source,sql]
----
SELECT tutorial.fname || ' ' || tutorial.lname AS adult,
    ARRAY child FOR child IN tutorial.children END AS children,
    ARRAY child.fname FOR child IN tutorial.children WHEN child.age >= 12 END AS teenagers
FROM tutorial WHERE tutorial.children IS NOT NULL;
----

Here is how to write the second and third lines using the DSL:

[source,java]
----
//import static com.couchbase.client.java.query.dsl.Expression.*;
//import static com.couchbase.client.java.query.dsl.functions.Collections.*;

//ARRAY child FOR child IN tutorial.children END AS children
arrayIn(x("child"), "child", path("tutorial", "children")).end().as("children");

//ARRAY child.fname FOR child IN tutorial.children WHEN child.age >= 12 END AS teenagers
arrayIn(path("child", "fname"), "child", path("tutorial", "children")).when(path("child", "age").gte(12)).as("teenagers"));
----

Similarly, `ANY` allows to test for a condition that applies to at least one member of a nested array (you can also match on `EVERY` member of the array).
`ANY` is defined as:

[source,sql]
----
ANY variable ( IN  | WITHIN ) expression
[  ,  variable ( IN | WITHIN ) expression  ]*
SATISFIES condition  END
----

In the previous example, you would see an entry for a parent that doesn't have "teenagers" (its "teenagers" field would be empty), because the statement didn't specify that the children should contain a "teenager".
You can fix that with `ANY`, by rewriting the `WHERE` clause:

[source,sql]
----
#...FROM tutorial
#replace "WHERE tutorial.children IS NOT NULL" with:
WHERE ANY child IN tutorial.children SATISFIES child.age >= 12;
----

[source,java]
----
//import static com.couchbase.client.java.query.dsl.Expression.*;
//import static com.couchbase.client.java.query.dsl.functions.Collections.*;

anyIn("child", x("tutorial.children")).satisfies(x("child.age").gte(12))
----
