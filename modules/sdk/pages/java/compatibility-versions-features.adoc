[#migrating]
== Migrating from Java SDK 1.4.x to 2.x

Couchbase recommends that you migrate to the Java 2.x SDK to take advantage of enhancements to the SDK as well as new features available in Couchbase Server.

The 2.x Java SDK is based on the reactive programming model and has a different architecture that uses a core I/O layer and a Java client layer.
It's asynchronous by design and offers performance, scalability, and durability enhancements.

This guide helps you migrate from the previous generation of the Java SDK (version `1.4.x`) to this new generation SDK (version `2.x`).

If you plan on using the synchronous blocking API, you can follow the simple migration path.
Or, you can follow the optional migration path to fully reactive and asynchronous code by using the asynchronous API, which provides the best performance.

To get the full benefit of using the asynchronous code with this new generation SDK, you need to understand how to build asynchronous yet expressive code by leveraging the `Observable` paradigm.
The xref:sdk:async-programming.adoc#async-programming-java[Asynchronous Progamming Using the Java SDK with Couchbase Server] has more information on reactive programming with the Java SDK.

== 1.x-2.x Migration: Getting Started

The 2.x generation of the Java SDK is a complete rewrite of the 1.x SDK.
It is layered into `core-io` and `java-client` pieces.
The `java-client` layer is more abstract and closer to the client.
The `core-io` layer is purely asynchronous and message-oriented.
It makes use of a reactive architecture based on http://netty.io[Netty], the https://github.com/LMAX-Exchange/disruptor/wiki[LMAX Disruptor], and most importantly https://github.com/ReactiveX/RxJava[RxJava].

IMPORTANT: The `core-io` layer is not intended for broad consumption.
In general, you should focus on using the `java-client` layer in your application.
For advanced use cases, when you are trying to squeeze out the very last drop of performance working with the raw byte stream or building a client layer in another language, you can use the `core-io` layer.

The client exposes the server-side concepts of a `Cluster` and `Bucket`s as first-class citizens that replace the previous `CouchbaseClient` class.
Each class exposes a *synchronous* API by default, but an *asynchronous* API (based on RxJava `Observable` objects) can be accessed simply by calling `async()` on either one.

This split also allows for much more efficient resource utilization.
In the past, each `CouchbaseClient` (for each bucket) had its resources, but now they are as shared as much as possible, and the `Cluster` and `Bucket` references can always be reused.

The `Maven` artifact has been renamed from `couchbase-client` to java-client to differentiate this rewrite from the previous generation.
It has minimal transitive dependencies (by embedding a few internal dependencies like Netty), most notably RxJava 1.x:

[source,xml]
----
<dependencies>
  <dependency>
    <groupId>com.couchbase.client</groupId>
    <artifactId>java-client</artifactId>
    <version>2.4.0</version>
  </dependency>
</dependencies>
----

IMPORTANT: After you've fully migrated, make sure that old dependencies to `couchbase-client` or dependencies introduced in your POM because of the `couchbase-client` have been removed.

You'll most probably want the SDK to perform some logging, which can easily be activated by adding a logging framework such as http://logging.apache.org/log4j/2.x/[log4j] to your dependencies.
For more information about configuring logging, see xref:sdk:collecting-information-and-logging.adoc[Collecting Information and Logging in the Java SDK with Couchbase Server].

== 1.x-2.x Migration: Cluster Connections

`CouchbaseClient` is replaced by the `Cluster` and `Bucket` classes, bringing real-world concepts of Couchbase into the SDK as first-class citizens.
For more information about using these classes, see xref:sdk:managing-connections.adoc[Managing Connections using the Java SDK with Couchbase Server].

Compared to the 1.4.x SDK, when providing a list of nodes for bootstrapping, you only need hostnames or IP addresses in `String` form.
No need for the URI anymore, and no need for the port and pools path either:

[source,java]
----
Cluster cluster = CouchbaseCluster.create("192.168.0.1");
----

The SDK uses the factory method pattern to create the Cluster object.
This pattern is heavily used throughout the SDK in place of constructors.

The `Cluster` and each `Bucket` reference must be reused as much as possible.
Make them singletons, which can be used by multiple threads safely.
Here's an example that uses a naive helper approach:

[source,java]
----
public class CouchbaseHelper {
    //the IPs / hostnames would be obtained from configuration file
    private static final List<String> SEED_IPS = Arrays.asList("192.168.0.1", "192.168.0.2");
    public static final Cluster CLUSTER = CouchbaseCluster.create(SEED_IPS);
    public static final Bucket EXAMPLEBUCKET = CLUSTER.openBucket("example", "p4ssW0rd");
}
----

You can xref:sdk:client-settings.adoc#topic_rwk_h3v_xv[customize] the connection to the `Cluster` via the `CouchbaseEnvironment` interface.

[source,java]
----
public class CouchbaseHelper {
    //the IPs / hostnames would be obtained from configuration file
    private static final List<String> SEED_IPS = Arrays.asList("192.168.0.1", "192.168.0.2");
    //the environment configuration
    private static final CouchbaseEnvironment ENV = DefaultCouchbaseEnvironment.builder()
        .connectTimeout(8 * 1000) // 8 Seconds in milliseconds
        .keepAliveInterval(3600 * 1000) // 3600 Seconds in milliseconds
        .build();
    public static final Cluster CLUSTER = CouchbaseCluster.create(ENV, SEED_IPS);
    public static final Bucket EXAMPLEBUCKET = CLUSTER.openBucket("example", "p4ssW0rd");
}
----

== 1.x-2.x Migration: Document Operations

In the new SDK, a new model of data within Couchbase was introduced: the `Document` class.
It encapsulates both the content itself and the metadata ( `id`, `expiry` and `cas` information).
The xref:sdk:document-operations.adoc#sdk-operations-java[CRUD Document Operations Using the Java SDK with Couchbase Server]  page shows more specifics regarding document operations with the 2.x version of the SDK.

The SDK has several implementations of `Document`.
By default, most SDK methods assume the content is JSON and return a `JsonDocument`.
This kind of document use standardized storing flags, which make it compatible with the other second generation SDKs in other languages.
If you already deal with JSON transcoding to domain objects, use the `RawJsonDocument` instead, which exposes the JSON String as content instead of a superfluous `JsonObject`.

NOTE: To interact with documents stored by an older Java SDK, use the `LegacyDocument` class.
This class provides 1:1 compatibility with the 1.4 SDK, but consider to migrate to a new implementation after backward compatibility isn't required anymore.

Concerning optimistic locking—because the CAS is now part of the `Document`, the SDK picks it up if it is non-zero during mutating operations.

== 1.x-2.x Migrations: Reactive and Batched Programming

In the 2.x SDK, asynchronous processing is done via RxJava.
The asynchronous API is not mixed with the synchronous API, but rather accessible via the `async()` method on `Cluster` and `Bucket`.

The SDK is thread-safe and uses a pool of threads internally for operations (so they are effectively processed in a separate thread).
Additionally, some Rx operators use one of the `Schedulers` provided by RxJava (meaning it could execute in another thread).

The SDK doesn't use `Future` objects anymore.
For progressive migration purposes, you can convert an `Observable` into a `Future` and vice versa.
Here's an example of how to do that:

[source,java]
----
//converting these to/from Future
Observable<String> myStringObservable;
Future<String> myStringFuture;
//this expects exactly one item emitted
Future<String> f = myStringObservable.toBlocking().toFuture();
//when several items expected, use a List
Future<List<String>> f = myStringObservable.toList().toBlocking().toFuture();
//convert back from a Future<String>
Observable<String> o = Observable.from(myStringFuture)
----
