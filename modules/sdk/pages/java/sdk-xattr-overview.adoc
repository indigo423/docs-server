= Extended Attributes

[abstract]
Couchbase Server permits the definition of _extended attributes_.
These allow application developers to define application-specific metadata that will only be visible to those applications that request it or attempt to modify it.
This might be, for example, meta-data specific to a programming framework that should be hidden by default from other frameworks, or possibly from other versions of the same framework.

== Language-Specific Variations

Each language supported by the Couchbase SDK implements extended-attribute support in a slightly different way.
For Java examples, see xref:sdk:sdk-xattr-example.adoc[Sample Code].

For detailed information on the Subdocument API, see xref:subdocument-operations.adoc[Subdocument Operations].
